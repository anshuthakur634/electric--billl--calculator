# ⚡ Electric Bill Calculator

The **Electric Bill Calculator** is a simple C++-based program designed to calculate electricity bills based on user input such as units consumed. This project demonstrates the use of basic C++ programming concepts like conditional statements, input/output operations, and arithmetic calculations.

It is especially useful for **college assignments, mini projects, and beginners** who want to understand how real-life billing logic is implemented in C.

## 📌 Project Overview

Electricity billing is a common real-world problem. This project simulates how an electricity bill is calculated based on the number of units consumed and predefined tariff slabs.

### Objectives:

* Take electricity units as input
* Apply slab-wise tariff rates
* Calculate total electricity bill
* Display the final bill amount

---

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Unit-based electricity bill calculation
✔️ Slab-wise tariff logic
✔️ Simple and clear output
✔️ Beginner-friendly C++ code
✔️ Easy to modify tariff rates

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Compiler:** G++ (or any C++ compiler)
* **Platform:** Windows / Linux / macOS

## 📥 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project on your system:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anshuthakur634/electric--billl--calculator.git
cd electric--billl--calculator
```

### 2️⃣ Compile the Program

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o electric_bill
```

> Replace `main.cpp` with the actual `.cpp` file name if different.
> userid admin
> password 12345

### 3️⃣ Run the Program

```bash
./electric_bill
```

(On Windows, use `electric_bill.exe`)

---

## 📖 How It Works

1. User enters the number of electricity units consumed
2. Program checks the unit range using conditional statements
3. Charges are calculated based on tariff slabs
4. Final bill amount is displayed on the screen

---

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter units consumed: 250
Total Electricity Bill = ₹1450
```

*(Output may vary depending on tariff logic used)*

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Variables and Data Types
* Conditional Statements (if-else)
* Arithmetic Operations
* Standard Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Add customer name and meter number
* Generate detailed bill format
* Add fixed charges and taxes
* Store bill records using file handling
* Convert to GUI-based application
